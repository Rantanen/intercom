error[E0038]: the trait `IFoo` cannot be made into an object

   |       ^^^^ `IFoo` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

   |       ---- this trait cannot be made into an object...
10 |     fn arg_type();
   |        ^^^^^^^^ ...because associated function `arg_type` has no `self` parameter
help: consider turning `arg_type` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument
   |
10 |     fn arg_type(&self);
   |                 ^^^^^
help: alternatively, consider constraining `arg_type` so it does not apply to trait objects
   |
10 |     fn arg_type() where Self: Sized;
   |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
